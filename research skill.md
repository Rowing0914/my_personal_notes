# Introduction
Lately, I am exploring, how great researchers read papers? how they stay up-to-date in the big
sea of research? how they pick such good questions from research papers?


# How to read papers? by Prof. Andrew Ng
## Intro

This is a lecture taught by Prof. Andrew Ng at Stanford. During this lecture, he explained how he read/organise papers and did some hands-on for students to read a paper he picked in advance.

- [Stanford CS230: Deep Learning | Autumn 2018 | Lecture 8 - Career Advice / Reading
  Research Papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI)

## Make a list of research papers to read

- Compile list of papers/blog posts: 10-20 is ideal???
  - Check the subsequent section: how to select papers?
- Skip around the list to choose which one to read carefully
- At this point, no need to fully understand any of them, just you can use the technique #1 explained in the next section.
- As you can see, he himself carries around this type of paper folder to read papers over and over again.

## How to read the selected papers
Read multiple times!!

1. Title, Abstract, Figures and see how well it's been formatted
2. Intro, Conclusions, Figures, Skim rest: skip maths!
3. Read it again but skim through maths
4. Read the whole thing but skip parts that you don't make sense
   1. BUT, for those who want to do PhD, pls take some time to understand everything
      deeply

## While Reading papers

After you went through the process above, ideally you are able to discuss

- What did authors try to accomplish?
- What were the key elements of the approach?
- What can you use yourself?
- What other references do fascinate you to follow?

## How to catch up with Maths?
Re-derive it from scratch to be able to fully understand how it works as well as apply it to your work in the future!!

## Make sure to check the codebase

If you find it interesting and would like to research more,

- Run the existing open-source code

- Try implementing it yourself

## How many papers to read per week?

- In general, he recommended to read 2 to 3 papers per week
- Even his weekly reading group at the lab at Stanford, he assigned papers to students and
  have them read/summarise/present the papers at the reading session.

## Sources of papers

- Twitter
- ML posts on Reddit
- NIPS/ICML/ICLR
- Friends

I'd like to add a bit more on this

- Deep Learning Monitor
- Arxiv Sanity Preserver
- Google Blog

## How one selects papers

- This section is not in his talk though, I thought this might be a good example of selecting papers

> Get the gestalt right. I remember being impressed with Fei-Fei (my adviser) once during a reviewing session. I had a stack of 4 papers I had reviewed over the last several hours and she picked them up, flipped through each one for 10 seconds, and said one of them was good and the other three bad. Indeed, I was accepting the one and rejecting the other three, but something that took me several hours took her seconds. Fei-Fei was relying on the gestalt of the papers as a powerful heuristic. Your papers, as you become a more senior researcher take on a characteristic look. An introduction of ~1 page. A ~1 page related work section with a good density of citations - not too sparse but not too crowded. A well-designed pull figure (on page 1 or 2) and system figure (on page 3) that were not made in MS Paint. A technical section with some math symbols somewhere, results tables with lots of numbers and some of them bold, one additional cute analysis experiment, and the paper has exactly 8 pages (the page limit) and not a single line less. You’ll have to learn how to endow your papers with the same gestalt because many researchers rely on it as a cognitive shortcut when they judge your work.

# How to summarise papers?

Regarding this point, I have found many good templates about how one can summarise papers on PPT, I list them below.

- For the presentation purpose
  - pls, google it and find the one fits you the most!
- For surveying purpose
  - When I googled it, it seemed that there weren't many resources about how your
    summarise papers during survey phase(In Prof Andrew's context, I assume, at the
    phase of compiling a list of papers of after!). So I've decided to summarise what I've
    found interesting

## PURPOSE OF A LITERATURE REVIEW
The purpose of a literature review is to:
1. Enable the student to develop skills to search, read, interpret
and summarize the literature on a particular subject.
2. Determine what is known and not known about a subject,
concept or problem in the area of nursing.
3. Determine gaps, consistencies and inconsistencies in the
literature about a subject, concept or problem.
4. Generate useful research questions/projects/activities for the
discipline.
5. Determine an appropriate research design to answer the
research question.
6. Promote development of protocols and policies related to
nursing practice.
7. Identify a new practice intervention, or provide evidence for
changing a practice intervention.

## Mentoring Tips: How to mentor Phd student and how to Feedback
- Be constructive
  - Give the alternative idea when you discuss, don't just say that it's bad
- Listen carefully
  - They might have thought of something that I've never thought of!
- Don't control too much, find the middle ground via discussion
  - Try to keep the direction as original as possible, i.e., the direction that he/she wants to

## Types of papers: Quote from [Ayush Jain](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~ayushj/)

- Paper’s contribution is msg about one key idea that is new and important. There seems to be 2 main kinds of contributions you could make with your paper
  1. Problem proposing paper -> Focus is on why your problem setting is interesting?
     - Identify a new problem setup that is meaningful for current or future research applications. Here the contribution is the novel problem itself and the method you propose will be new by definition (and also the “SOTA”).
  2. Methodological paper -> Focus is on why your method is interesting?
     - Identify a problem/issue in the existing methods for topics that your community cares about. Propose a solution that tackles that issue. If your hypothesis is correct, then you would naturally beat the SOTA. But beating SOTA is not the main point. Contribution is still about the problem you identified and solved.
       ** SOTAs come and go, but ideas are transferable and reusable.

- Apart from these, there are several other ways to make research contributions such as rigorously analyzing issues in what works and what doesn’t, benchmarking current algorithms, and novel datasets or environments that further the frontier of research.

## Resarch Procedural Tips
- Brainstorm with more depth of interleaving questioning and answering, don't stop with first layer of questions in idea generation
  - top-down: start with the problem, narrow down to solution space
  - bottom-up: start from specific insights, and go upwards to solve bigger family, more universal problems
- Constant thinking and reading to refine the process
- Statement with common technical language that everybody is familiar with to reduce ambiguity


## Code submission prep todos
- Remove non-anonymous references: name(individual / company / team / server name / etc)
- Add requirements, experiments, analyses cmds to README
- Add brief intro to the beginning and quantitative results to the end of README.md
- Remove any unnecessary files that are not used anywhere. This requires a pass-through of the entire codebase.
- Delete all __pycache__ folders
- Finally, git pull in a new folder, delete .git and .gitignore and then make the zip file to upload


## Slide Prep tips
- Be wary of how to make it visually appealing. For example, using red colour in text is not so pleasing. You can try bold or some other colour that is easier on the eye.
- Think from the perspective of a new viewer who has no idea about our project
  - How can we make them understand the important parts in the easiest manner?
- Wherever we can explain something with videos, or transitions or an animated build-up of figures, do it
- Make results look more attractive but be faithful!!
- Key words: Conciseness / Clarity / Perspective of a new viewer / Presentation / Aesthetics

## How to present a poster at a conference?: [Link](https://twitter.com/jbhuang0604/status/1518097856325996545)
- *Be Welcoming*
  - Stand by the side of the poster.
  - Never face the poster and turn your back on your audience.
  - Actively approach people walking by.
- *Be Enthusiastic*
  - If you do not sound excited about your work, why should others be excited? Hype yourself up! People can feel the positive energy and will be willing to learn more about your work.
- *Be Early and Stay Late*
  - There are fewer people *before* and *after* the scheduled poster session. Don't miss the great opportunity to have interesting, long conversation with people genuinely interested in your work.
- *Be Concise*
  - Bad: Present linearly from top to bottom for 10 mins. 
  - Good: Present an elevator pitch for 30 seconds. Hook the audience and then respond to any questions.
- *Use Tools*
  - Poster is just a *static* visual abstract. If your work involve other *dynamic* mediums (e.g., video, sound), bringing a laptop or tablet would make your presentation a lot more engaging.
- *No "Do you know X?"*
  - Yes, your intention is good, but this only makes other people feel dumb.
  - Give a 10 sec background about X and then focus on *your work*.
- *Handout*
  - Print several mini-poster as handout so that you can give people who are interested in learning more. Make sure that the poster has link/barcode that refer them to your project page.
- *Build Your Network*
  - Thank *each* person for stopping by your poster and/or asking good questions.
  - Say their name (or ask how to pronounce their name).
- *Bring People to Your Poster*
  - Senior folks: Bring other senior people you know to your students' poster!
  - Nothing is more validating than presenting your work to researchers whom you look up to.
- *Make a Good Poster*
  - All the presentation tips won't work if you have a crappy poster.


## Intro Writing Tips by [Ayush Jain](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~ayushj/)
The general procedure for intro writing depends on the kind of paper it is. It usually requires a lot of trial and error to find out the best version to explain your idea, so there’s no single solution that fits everywhere. Here’s the way that worked for his two papers, where he proposed a new problem framework(ie, Problem Proposing paper of above).

- Intuition paragraph: Give an intuitive example of what your problem is and how we as humans solve that problem. It is a setup for the whole paper.
Problem paragraph: State your problem setting. Differentiate it from general prior work and specific prior work that could potentially be applicable for this problem. Finally, state your problem goal clearly.
- Importance of this problem: Why are we solving this problem? What will this achieve if we can solve it successfully? Since we mention applications already here, we can also talk about the environments we tackle in our paper, to emphasize what we have been able to achieve by solving this problem.
- Challenges in solving this problem: List all the technical challenges required to solve this problem.
- Solution: What is your solution to these challenges? — Describe your method in simple terms, yet focusing on the important novel components.
- Contributions: Clearly state what is new in your paper. Why should a reader care about your paper? Keep it short and focused, instead of writing everything possible. e.g. We identified this problem, proposed a solution with this insight, and this enables us to solve these applications.
- Important points:
  - everything should follow one coherent story. Carefully think about the sentence flow (low-level) and paragraph flow (high-level).
  - keep the intro as short and concise as possible. Don’t add any detail that is not important — even if you took the longest time to figure that detail out.
  - re-read everything as a new reader. Does everything make perfect sense? If something is hand-wavy, then clarify it or minimize it if you know that there is nothing you can do to make it clearer.

## Tips: What does "Carefully read a paper" mean?
- Analyse the exps results to see if the proposed method really works or it has some flaw
- Check if the proposition is evaluated correctly through exp results
- See if the paper is critical to the project from various perspectives
  - eg., What's our contribution? what can we improve? any limitation
