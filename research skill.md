# Introduction
Lately, I am exploring, how great researchers read papers? how they stay up-to-date in the big
sea of research? how they pick such good questions from research papers?


# How to read papers? by Prof. Andrew Ng
## Intro

This is a lecture taught by Prof. Andrew Ng at Stanford. During this lecture, he explained how he read/organise papers and did some hands-on for students to read a paper he picked in advance.

  Research Papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI)

## Make a list of research papers to read

- Compile list of papers/blog posts: 10-20 is ideal???
  - Check the subsequent section: how to select papers?
- Skip around the list to choose which one to read carefully
- At this point, no need to fully understand any of them, just you can use the technique #1 explained in the next section.
- As you can see, he himself carries around this type of paper folder to read papers over and over again.

## How to read the selected papers
Read multiple times!!

1. Title, Abstract, Figures and see how well it's been formatted
2. Intro, Conclusions, Figures, Skim rest: skip maths!
3. Read it again but skim through maths
4. Read the whole thing but skip parts that you don't make sense
   1. BUT, for those who want to do PhD, pls take some time to understand everything
      deeply

## While Reading papers

After you went through the process above, ideally you are able to discuss

- What did authors try to accomplish?
- What were the key elements of the approach?
- What can you use yourself?
- What other references do fascinate you to follow?

## How to catch up with Maths?
Re-derive it from scratch to be able to fully understand how it works as well as apply it to your work in the future!!

## Make sure to check the codebase

If you find it interesting and would like to research more,

- Run the existing open-source code

- Try implementing it yourself

## How many papers to read per week?

- In general, he recommended to read 2 to 3 papers per week
- Even his weekly reading group at the lab at Stanford, he assigned papers to students and
  have them read/summarise/present the papers at the reading session.

## Sources of papers

- Twitter
- ML posts on Reddit
- NIPS/ICML/ICLR
- Friends

I'd like to add a bit more on this

- Deep Learning Monitor
- Arxiv Sanity Preserver
- Google Blog

## How one selects papers

- This section is not in his talk though, I thought this might be a good example of selecting papers

> Get the gestalt right. I remember being impressed with Fei-Fei (my adviser) once during a reviewing session. I had a stack of 4 papers I had reviewed over the last several hours and she picked them up, flipped through each one for 10 seconds, and said one of them was good and the other three bad. Indeed, I was accepting the one and rejecting the other three, but something that took me several hours took her seconds. Fei-Fei was relying on the gestalt of the papers as a powerful heuristic. Your papers, as you become a more senior researcher take on a characteristic look. An introduction of ~1 page. A ~1 page related work section with a good density of citations - not too sparse but not too crowded. A well-designed pull figure (on page 1 or 2) and system figure (on page 3) that were not made in MS Paint. A technical section with some math symbols somewhere, results tables with lots of numbers and some of them bold, one additional cute analysis experiment, and the paper has exactly 8 pages (the page limit) and not a single line less. Youâ€™ll have to learn how to endow your papers with the same gestalt because many researchers rely on it as a cognitive shortcut when they judge your work.

# How to summarise papers?

Regarding this point, I have found many good templates about how one can summarise papers on PPT, I list them below.

- For the presentation purpose
  - pls, google it and find the one fits you the most!
- For surveying purpose
  - When I googled it, it seemed that there weren't many resources about how your
    summarise papers during survey phase(In Prof Andrew's context, I assume, at the
    phase of compiling a list of papers of after!). So I've decided to summarise what I've
    found interesting

## Work Log System

In order to keep track of the progress of your research project, some people discuss how to efficiently do this as follows;

## PURPOSE OF A LITERATURE REVIEW
The purpose of a literature review is to:
1. Enable the student to develop skills to search, read, interpret
and summarize the literature on a particular subject.
2. Determine what is known and not known about a subject,
concept or problem in the area of nursing.
3. Determine gaps, consistencies and inconsistencies in the
literature about a subject, concept or problem.
4. Generate useful research questions/projects/activities for the
discipline.
5. Determine an appropriate research design to answer the
research question.
6. Promote development of protocols and policies related to
nursing practice.
7. Identify a new practice intervention, or provide evidence for
changing a practice intervention.

## Where to publish
- Conferences
- PrePrint Server, eg., arXiv
- Journals() without APC or with affordable APC)
