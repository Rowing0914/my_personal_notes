## PRIOR TO CLASS
1. Pretest: Taking a small quiz before you start learning allows you to benefit from the hypercorrection effect.
2. Stop and Recite
When being exposed to learning material for the first time, -> stop after every section/idea/concept/process -> close book/pause video -> recite what you have just learned in own words -> the more explicit you are by writing, typing or saying the better

## DURING CLASS
3. Write in-class questions: -> for definitions and facts use What is … ? questions. -> for processes/method/procedures/ techniques use How? questions. -> use Why? questions for deeper understanding -> answer the lecture objectives/review questions

## AFTER CLASS
4. Immediately review your in class questions after class
5. use toggles within note taking app ( remnote) -> allows to see forest from trees
6. use mindmaps -> blank piece of paper -> pick a topic of study -> brain dump everything you know about the topic -> actively link ideas to one another
7. Teaching ( feynman technique/ protege effect) -> do a brain splurge of all the concepts that you have learned from memory by writing it out or teaching it in own words -> type as if its a script, forces you to choose your words carefully -> pretend teaching to a 7 year old ( use as little jargon as possible) -> pretend to teach an outsider -> pretend to teach a nosy friend ( keep answering “why” repeatedly)

## ETERNAL MEMORY
8. Digital Flashcards!! -> remnote, supermemo, anki -> interleaving -> spaced repetition -> premade decks
9. Enumeration -> particularly useful for process and problem based classes -> list of steps to execute in particular order
10. Occlusion -> images, structures, graphs, charts, anatomy, surgery -> image occlusion functions in SRS -> alternative use word doc and cover answer with shape, delete to reveal -> cloze deletions for words in sentences

## HOME STRETCH
11. Problem sets -> make sure they come with answers and explanations -> understand why wrong answers are wrong and why right answers are right
12. practice tests -> mimic test conditions as much as possible -> timing, bathroom breaks, earplugs, mask etc… -> gauge which topics are strengths and which are weaknesses
